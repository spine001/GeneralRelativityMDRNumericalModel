Massless Calibration Benchmark Report

Simulation context
We numerically tested the Modified Dispersion Relation (MDR) that emerges when proper time is discretized at the Planck scale. The low-energy expansion of this MDR predicts a quartic correction term:

Interpretation: Role of

theory
	​


The code does not inject the theoretical value into the fit.

Instead:

𝑎

4

	​

 is computed once and printed for reference.

𝑎
4
mean
a
4

	​

 comes from analytic fitting of numerical MDR data.

𝑎
4
resid_mean
a
4
resid_mean
	​

 comes from independent residual analysis.

The fact that both independent estimators converge to the analytic value is the core validation of the framework.

This shows that our simulation faithfully recovers the Planck-scale correction from raw numerical data, not from circular input.

Why This Matters

Numerical stability proven – estimator works across huge sample sizes.

Independent confirmation – simulation retrieves analytic

	​

 with 1:1 agreement.

Foundation for new physics – now we can confidently extend the MDR analysis to:

massive particles,

higher-order terms,

curved spacetimes,

thermal/nonequilibrium regimes.

✅ Conclusion:
The calibration benchmark demonstrates that our numerical engine can self-recover the quartic MDR coefficient with essentially perfect fidelity. This resolves doubts about circularity and confirms that our low-energy calibration is a solid foundation for exploring unexplored regimes.
